These are some basic benchmarking and unit tests.

genbench is a program you run on your host to produce benchmark.c
It generates some symbols. Default benchmark.c contains 128 + 1 function symbols

benchmark.c is just to see how efficiently elfloader can load all the symbols
test.c is the wrapper
unittest.c does a unit test on the loader

Put benchmark.elf.tns, test.elf.tns and unittest.elf.tns in the same folder at runtime and run test.c
